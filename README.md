# Problem

Waiting weeks to get paid is outdated. Traditional payroll systems follow rigid cycles (bi-weekly or monthly), causing financial stress, reliance on credit, and missed opportunities for employees.
For companies: Slow, costly, and error-prone payroll processes, especially for international payments.
Lack of flexibility: Employees lack access to real-time payments, cryptocurrencies, or rewards for waiting.
No service offers second-by-second payments (Payments Stream).

# Solution
Streaming Payroll in Real-Time

 ✅ Employees to track earnings by the minute and get paid daily
 ✅ Companies to reduce payroll costs and optimize treasury management
 ✅ Secure, transparent, and automated payments
